# Culinary Data Science Analysis

## Introduction

This project investigates the relationship between the preparation time of recipes and their user ratings. By analyzing data from Food.com, we aim to uncover whether quicker recipes tend to be rated as highly as those that take longer to prepare. This analysis is valuable for home cooks who want to optimize their time in the kitchen while still preparing highly rated dishes.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset contains information about recipes from Food.com, including details such as preparation time, nutritional information, and user ratings.

### Number of Rows
